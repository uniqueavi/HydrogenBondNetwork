Comprehensive Stability Analysis of Different Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Causing EGFR Dimers

Lung cancer is the foremost reason of cancer deaths in the world. The survival rate of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) positive patients
is increasing with the improvements in the field of computational and clinical biology. A specific change in the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) causes point mutation or complex mutation (deletion and insertion), which is the root cause of NSCLC. EGFR's extracellular 
ligand-binding region gets stimulated due to its growth factor ligands, and the transition occurs from an inactive monomeric structure to an 
activated homodimer with another EGFR or a heterodimer with another ErbB receptor family member. The eminence L858R mutation takes place in 
the EGFR kinase domain and causes NSCLC, and after a few months of treatment, T790M drug resistance mutation occurs. In our research, we have 
considered three EGFR dimers (EGFR-EGFR, EGFR-cMET, EGFR-ErbB2) and formed a hydrogen bond network to track their behavioral changes for 
wildtype, L858R, L858R/T790M mutational structure. Further, we found how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are changing in the network to prove 
the stability changes for different structures. The results obtained from this work can lead to further designs of targeted therapeutics and 
innovative drug development for lung cancer treatment.
